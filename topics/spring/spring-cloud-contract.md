## Spring Cloud Contract
Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is a tool that enables Consumer Driven Contract (CDC).
It is shipped with Contract Definition Language (DSL).

Contract definitions are used to produce following resources:
- HTTP Server Stub: JSON stub definitions to be used by WireMock
- Messaging routes if youâ€™re using one.
- Acceptance tests (in JUnit or Spock)

### Terms
- _Producer_ publish API
- _Consumer_ use API
- _Contract_ agreement between producer and consumer
- _Consumer Driver Contract_ consumer drives changes of API by producer
